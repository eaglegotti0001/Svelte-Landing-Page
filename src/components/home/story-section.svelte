				State Listings, Inc. began in 2009 as NY State MLS. Born from a desire to create a common sense MLS solution, New Yorkâ€™s statewide Multiple Listing Service quickly garnered agents across the state - as well as nationwide attention and demand for our
				services. 10 years later, our nationwide Multiple Listing Service, My State MLS, has agents in all 50 states and Puerto Rico. In addition to our MLSs, our services have expanded to include IDX feeds, website design, and private MLS administration.
